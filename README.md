## Description:

Building a prototype application to relocate information currently stored in a very long google sheet into its own stand alone application with the future goal of being integrated into Tuition.ioâ€™s
internal user/partner admin platform. The application will also have advanced filtering functionality that allows the user to check what programs have specific loan eligibility criteria and export a
CSV document with that list of partners.
